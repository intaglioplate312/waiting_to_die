<h1>Artist&#8217;s Journal</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of this date Saturday, Sept. 18, 2010, I have finished 6 profile paintings, and have lined up for sure 5 people, and possibly 9 more. Will have to start bringing people to the studio, or go to them to get them to pose. I am very excited about this project, as we have one gallery site that has shown interest in having a one man show to showcase the works.</p>
<p>I estimate it will take me about 10 months to 1 year to do the 50 profile paintings (now 44) to complete the project, and that is if I am able to do one a week. Right now (Saturday Sept. 18, 2010), I have started another painting unrelated to the project at hand, as I have not lined up anyone to pose for me. I will ask neighbors first that have agreed to pose, as they are the easiest to bring to the studio. A lot of the people I am using are retired, so it should not be difficult to get to them.</p>
<p>It is now Thursday, Sept. 23, 2010, and I have not lined up anyone to pose for me. I know that I will be able to get some people to pose on this Sunday, as we will be at a BBQ at nieces house, and some of our older relatives will be there also. At least one of them already indicated that they would pose. So, for now, I will just keep working on the painting I started a few days ago. The painting is a side of a dilapidated house with a figure in the window, a ghostly figure. The painting, which is 12&quot; x 16&quot;, with the amount of detail I will be putting in it will take about 1 ½ to 2 months. Am excited about this one, as am coming up with new elements to put in it all the time. </p>
<p>Sunday, October 10, 2010. Just started working on another profile painting, it is of <a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide38.html">Marsha</a>, Joyce's' cousin. I started working on it in between drying times for the other painting I'm working on. Am almost finished with the 12&quot; x 16&quot; painting, only have about 12 hours left on it.</p>
  <p>I was able to get 5 additional people to pose for me yesterday at the neighborhood block party. All the neighbors that I approached posed willingly with no problems. Of course, I have known these people for 40 years. I now have 12 people that posed for me. 50 people still seems a long way away! Although, I have been painting almost every day, and am putting between 1 to 8 hours in the studio. Back to work now, just needed a break.....</p>
<p>Saturday, October 30, 2010. Stopped work on the Marsha painting....just did not feel right. I gessoed the board out, and laid in another profile. It is of <a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide42.html">Denise</a>, an older retired neighbor who posed for me a few weeks ago. I am about 4-5 hours from completion on this one. It is looking o.k. Skin is real white, hard to capture the color, but I'll get it, just a matter of time..... </p>
<p>Finished 8&quot; x 8&quot; portrait of &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide42.html">Denise</a>&quot; and I did finish the other painting I was working on, the one with the ghostly figure in the window. Just finished giving it a coat of flat water based varnish. After I sign my initials on it (R M P), I will give it coat of gloss water based varnish. This tends to make the colors look richer and deeper. I like a gloss finish on the paintings. Am also trying to come up with a title for the piece.....I decided that the barn wood frame I had for it just did not look right, so I bought a large damaged frame, and gave it a coat of black paint today, and it looks just perfect for this piece!</p>
 <p> I finally have a title for the 12&quot; x 16&quot;, thanks to <a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide41.html">Joyce</a>, it is &quot;Dear Departed&quot;...seems to work....</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder why life is so depressing for a lot of people.....nothing but disapointment, anxiety, unrealizes dreams, suffering, pain, and finally death.....</p>
<p>Just started laying out another big painting. I think it will work out to be 14&quot; x 24&quot;, vertical. It is called &quot;Ihe Chopping Block&quot;....I know it sounds creepy, but these images just keep popping into my head, and I have to let them out. Should be able to start work on the actual painting in about a week or so, after I finish all the preliminary drawings and refine the composition. Only one figure in this one. It will be a challenge. Am also working on my preliminary sketches of the next profile painting. This one is of &quot;Frank&quot;, one of my neighbors that I have known for 40 years. Will be able to start work on it in 10- 12 days, as we are going up to the cabin in the north woods to close it up for the season. Will be there for only a few days. I am already looking forward to getting back so I can start work on these pieces. It is 7:15 p.m., and I got a lot done today. Time to stop for now, but it is difficult. The studio and the work is all consuming, I only stop because the night lighting in the studio is very poor.</p>
<p>January 7, 2011, Friday....finished three 8&quot; x 8&quot; profiles, and they are: &quot;Frank&quot;, &quot;Susan&quot;, and &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide49.html">Norman</a>&quot;....should have 10 done now, and am putting gesso on 4 more 8&quot; x 8&quot; boards today....have finished pre-lim drawing for &quot;Joy&quot;, my next 8&quot; x 8&quot;.......have also finished drawings for the 14&quot; x 24&quot; painting, but need to get board cut to size so I can prime it....painting will be &quot;All Hallows Eve&quot;, not the &quot;Chopping Block&quot;. I am over a month behind on starting the 14&quot; x 24&quot; painting. Very frustrating to me.</p>
<p>February 1, 2011....Finished &quot;Joy&quot; 8&quot; x 8&quot; painting, and just finished &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide43.html">Sharon</a>&quot; 8&quot; x 8&quot; painting a day ago....that makes 12 profile paintings. Will be laying out another today....am going to attempt to do &quot;Marsha&quot; again. Had disastrous results last time I started painting it....gessoed over it and painted another profile in its place....have also started painting the 11&quot; x 14&quot; piece. It is called &quot;First Cup&quot;, a painting of <a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide41.html">Joyce</a> in the morning.....will block in all the colors in the background and foreground in a   wash before I start working on the main figure....will determine at that time if the overall color scheme  is what I am looking for....This piece will be of a more tranquil than other ones I have completed, as many have a darker side to them....</p>
<p>I paint for myself and I paint for everyone, and maybe I paint for no one, it is what it is. Although some of it reflects my masculine side, and some of it reflects my feminine side, but all of it reflects my darker side....</p>
<p>March 20, 2011.....Saturday 6:30 p.m......Just completed the &quot;First Cup&quot; 11&quot; x 14&quot; acrylic painting two days ago, and also finished another 8&quot; x 8&quot; profile painting 3 days ago. This 8&quot; x 8&quot; is the second one of <a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide41.html">Joyce</a>, as she wasn't too happy with the first one. Will call the first one &quot;Roslyn&quot; (her middle name), and will only use it in the series if I have to. Also, started another &quot;Marsha&quot; 8&quot; x 8&quot; yesterday. This one is going to be o.k., as the color on the face is good, and the likeness is good. </p>
 <p> Will be laying out the 14&quot; x 24&quot; painting tomorrow (All Hollow's Eve). Am looking forward to this one, as it is quite a challenge. Many elements in it, and lots of contrasting color.</p>
  <p>My next 8&quot; x 8&quot; painting after I finish &quot;Marsha&quot; will be &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide37.html">Patricia</a>&quot; (Pat O'Mally), as she just turned 50, and is a good person and friend. Thats it for now.</p>
<p>April 26, 2011....Tuesday 10:00 a.m......Finished &quot;Marsha&quot; 8&quot; x 8&quot; a few weeks ago, and it came out o.k.....also finished &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide37.html">Patricia</a>&quot;(Pat O'mally) 8&quot; x 8&quot; painting a week ago, and now am working on &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide31.html">Orisha</a>&quot;(Kulick) 8&quot; x 8&quot;...<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide31.html">Orisha</a>'s skin is a challenge as it is very light.....am going to lighten up the sweater she is wearing as it is too dark, and will lighten up her hair tie also....Also, finally laid out the &quot;All Hallows Eve&quot; painting, and am ready to start.....</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder why I dream dark......</p>
<p>June 23, 2011.....Thursday 8:30 p.m......Since april 26, finished &quot;Marsha&quot;, &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide37.html">Patricia</a>&quot;, &quot;Orisha&quot;, &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide36.html">Camille</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide34.html">Gregory</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide32.html">Olive</a>&quot;.....have also started &quot;All Hallows Eve&quot;painting....had to set up easel to work on it standing up because it is larger than I am used to painting......going to be a challenge....am working on &quot;PhilAnn&quot; 8&quot; x 8&quot; painting and hope to finish it in a few days.....am finished for evening, as to let paint set overnight, to get nice and hard....will give &quot;.....Eve&quot; painting a coat of flat varnish on the sky tomorrow, so I can lay in some trees and ravens.....just sketched out another large painting that will have at least 7 to 10 figures in it....I know that I can't start on it for a few months, but will be gathering reference material and people to pose for it in the meantime......</p>
<p>July 19, 2011.....Tuesday 4:25 p.m......Finished &quot;PhilAnn&quot; 8&quot; x 8&quot; painting a week ago, and am working on &quot;Cindy&quot; painting, should finish this week....am working on &quot;.....Eve&quot; painting also....finished sky with birds....also finished creature skeleton for cage in the studio....it looks good as it is the second tier from the bottom...am contemplating having the creature sitting on a bed of nails, or in some sort of bubbling mass...am still working on it....also lined up 3 more people to pose for me....did prelim photos and sketches, but need to get some more 8&quot; x 8&quot; board to paint on.....still having trouble with flesh tones, as you would think that it would get easier as the more paintings I do, but it doesn't as everyones flesh tone is different....I have to stop working on the portraits every so often, as I need to do work on other projects...but, the big problem is, so many interruptions! I am really hard pressed to find a large block of time to work in the studio....I thought I would have at least 30-35 paintings done by this time, but as it is , I am working on number 21.....</p>
<p>July 21, 2011.....Thursday 6 p.m......just finished &quot;<a href="manual_slideshow/slideshow_slide35.html">Cyndi</a>&quot; 8&quot; x 8&quot; profile portrait...she is our foster child who is now 54 years old....flesh tone once again came out to red, and was having trouble toning it down...same problem keeps on occurring with all the paintings, as I am trying to get closer to a true flesh tone...but, I tried something different this time, I gave the area that was giving me trouble a wash of Apple Barrel# 20582 Creamy Peach color that I got at Michael's craft store and it worked!...color looks more natural.....the bottle of color is acrylic, and is used for painting and crafts...I sure hope its permanent, as I've used these colors on all my paintings, but I am mostly using Liquetex acrylics now....hard to break away from those colors, as cost was a factor as to why I started buying them in the first place (.88 per bottle as apposed to $3.50 and up for  for a bottle of Liquetex acrylic.....</p>
 <p> Will be starting on a 8&quot; x 8&quot; of James in a day or so, but first will be working on the All Hallows Eve painting for a few days......</p>
